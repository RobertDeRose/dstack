# dstack Core Contracts

This support skill contains the shared contracts used by the dstack workflows.

Before executing a dstack workflow that links to a reference in this directory, read that reference completely. The
calling skill remains responsible for its workflow-specific authority and completion rules.

## Feature resolution

`<core-dir>/scripts/resolve-feature.py` resolves feature epics through Beads by canonical number/slug, number, exact or
unique human name, or ID. Use `--next` to select the next ready feature epic. Workflow commands should expose the
canonical `<num>-<slug>` reference and retain the Beads ID only for mutations and audit evidence.
